Explanation:

req (Request):
This object encapsulates all the information about the incoming HTTP request. It contains details like the request method (GET, POST, etc.), the URL, headers, and any data sent with the request.

res (Response): 
This object allows the server to construct and send back an HTTP response to the client. It provides methods to set headers, status codes, and write the actual response body.

In essence, req is used to read and process information from the client, and res is used to send information back to the client.
For example, in a web server, you might use req to access the URL of a requested page and then use res to send back the appropriate HTML, JSON, or other data to the client's browser. `);
