# computer_science_degree_projects
This is a repository where I keep all my degree projects that I think are interesting.


## The Night Monster Game
This is the first project in my degree that I added to my repository, with this project I was able to make an interesting project with JavaScript that is playable and enjoyable to the user. It was good learning since the majority of my projects do not serve much in the visuals or easy interactions with the users so I decided to add it to my school portfolio (, and it is pink!).
