# This is the Final Project of my Introduction to Programming Class.
On this class, I had the opportunity to learn some interesting skills with p5.js since I didn't have much experience with javascript previews to it.

Below I describe some of the features expected from this project and some of the extra features implemented by me to make it unique.

## Unique Features
For this project with the intention of making it unique we have added the following features:
- [x] Pretty start-game face with a start button
- [x] A Game Story
- [x] A Second Level
- [x] A randomized scenario to make it more special every time you play the game
- [x] Separated files for different aspects of the code

## Base Game Checklist
- [x] Functional and bug-free 
- [x] Player interaction
- [x] Canyons & Coins interaction 
- [x] A scrollable game world 
- [x] Score and life counters 
- [x] Game over states
- [x] Create a playable but challenging level design
- [x] Create coherent and aesthetically pleasing graphics and animations
- [x] Making sure your game is bug-free and that the player controls are well-tweaked (eg. the jump is well-timed)
- [x] Indentation is correct
- [x] Whitespace (empty lines and spaces) is properly used
- [x] inline comments but NOT commented out code
- [x] Consistent and logical variable naming (at least for me)
- [x] Good code organization 
- [x] Implicitly declared variables, redundant variable declarations or assignments 
- [x] Appropriate use of local and global variables 
- [x] Array traversal is correctly implemented
- [x] Data structures and function design follow the prescribed scheme or a more advanced scheme that is rational in its design.
- [x] Conditional logic is clearly and plainly implemented. 
- [x] Game elements are correctly anchored
