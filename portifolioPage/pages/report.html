        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>What is the essential story being told by your portfolio site? Describe the version of 
            you that it is about. What is the audience you are addressing? What type of structure did you 
            choose to implement?</p>
        <p>The essential narrative of my portfolio site is to offer a comprehensive view of my professional journey and personal interests. It aims to present a multifaceted version of myself, encompassing my career in data engineering, my contributions to educational content for children, and my passion for photography. The primary audience for this site includes potential employers, collaborators, and individuals interested in my work and hobbies.</p>
        <p>Regarding the structure, I opted for a versatile layout that integrates various elements to reflect different aspects of my professional and personal life. The site features distinct sections dedicated to my projects, writings, and hobbies, each with its own visual and functional characteristics. This approach allows for a clear and organized presentation of my work while ensuring an engaging user experience.</p>

    <section id="inspiration">
        <h2>Inspiration</h2>
        <p>State 3 professional portfolio sites (not advice articles or portfolio templates) that 
            have inspired you when creating your website. What did you learn from them?</p>
        <p>My design and functionality choices were influenced by several notable portfolio sites, each contributing unique elements to my project:</p>
        <p>1. <a href="https://www.joshloveslight.com/" target="_blank">Josh Loves Light</a>: This site prominently features a gallery of photographs with a clean and engaging layout. I was inspired by the way images are showcased upfront, which significantly influenced my decision to highlight my photography work in a similar manner. Implementing a hover effect that enlarges images while dimming the rest of the page was particularly impactful.</p>
        <p>2. <a href="https://www.book-by-its-cover.com/" target="_blank">Book by Its Cover</a>: This site presents books in a well-organized grid layout. I appreciated the clarity and visual appeal of this arrangement, leading me to adopt a similar approach for displaying various sections of my portfolio, including educational materials.</p>
        <p>3. <a href="https://www.nathalie-lete.com/" target="_blank">Nathalie Lété</a>: Known for its minimalist design, this site inspired me to experiment with a notebook-style presentation for my zine portfolio. The use of random CSS values in conjunction with JavaScript for dynamic visual effects was an innovative technique that I incorporated into my project.</p>
        <p>Bonus: <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/114963391/Netflixs-Moxie-Zines" target="_blank">Netflix’s Moxie Zines on Behance</a>: The site's fanzine aesthetic, featuring a handmade and punk-inspired design, was a major influence. I aimed to evoke a similar feel in my portfolio to give it a unique, personal touch.</p>

            <li>Keyboard Navigation: The site supports full keyboard navigation, allowing users who cannot use a mouse to interact with all interactive elements.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="usability">
        <h2>Usability</h2>
        <p>State 3 ways in which you considered the usability of your site.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Consistent Navigation: Consistent navigation elements across all pages ensure a seamless user experience and help visitors easily find the content they are looking for.</li>
            <li>Responsive Design: The site is designed to be fully responsive, providing an optimal viewing experience across a variety of devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.</li>

    </section>
    <section id="learning">
        <h2>Learning</h2>
        <p>State 3 things you had to learn or find out to create your site. How did you achieve that?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>JSON Integration: I learned how to fetch and integrate JSON data into my project by studying online tutorials and documentation. This allowed me to dynamically load and display content.</li>
            <li>Handlebars.js: I utilized Handlebars.js to create dynamic templates for presenting content. I followed tutorials and example projects to understand its implementation and effectively use it in my site. Despite initial challenges, once I overcame these obstacles, Handlebars.js proved to be a practical and powerful tool throughout the project.</li>
            <li>CSS Z-Index: I explored the use of CSS z-index to manage layer stacking and control the visibility of elements. This involved experimenting with different values and reading documentation to achieve the desired visual effects.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="evaluation">
        <h2>Evaluation</h2>
        <h3>1. What aspects of your work do you think were particularly successful? Why?</h3>
        <p>The use of Handlebars.js and CSS Grid for the photography section was highly effective, providing a dynamic and visually appealing gallery. The implementation of JavaScript for reusable footer and navigation code also contributed to a more maintainable and efficient project. Additionally, the overall design and content integration successfully conveyed my professional and personal interests.</p>
        <h3>2. What aspects of your work could be improved? How might you do things differently another time?</h3>
        <p>Some challenges were encountered with the styling of dynamically generated content via JavaScript, which did not always function as intended. In future projects, I would focus on more thorough testing of dynamic styles and interactions. Additionally, I would enhance the personalization of the index page and explore incorporating varied image sizes in the photography gallery to improve visual interest and user engagement. Furthermore, I am interested in incorporating 3D elements into the website, as this trend is gaining traction and could enhance the visual appeal and interactivity of the site.</p>
